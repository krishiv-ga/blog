Inflation is the rise of general price levels. It can have severe consequences for the economy, devastating short term growth and harming the potential of long term development. Rising prices can lead to increased unemployment as production costs shoot up and employers lay off workers to maintain margins. They can result in a worsening of the influence of the nation in international markets as the national product becomes less competitive with increased prices. Most importantly, rising prices can lead to poverty as people can afford less with the same income resulting in a lower standard of living.

When we talk about inflation in a negative sense, we are usually referring to high inflation. Most nations have a target of inflation from 2 to 4 percent, a small growth in price over time shows that there is more demand than supply, encouraging producers to expand in prospect of higher margins. When inflation goes above target, such as the alarming 9.1 percent during June 2022 in the USA, it can cause problems as market certainity dips and prices soar at rates that supply realistically can’t keep up with. As shown in the graph below, wages have risen but the real wage [1] has remained the same.

One of the prerequisites to high inflation being problematic, especially for an individual, is if wages aren’t able to keep up with inflation. This results in a smaller real salary over time, meaning the person has less disposable income [2]. Less disposable income means you can’t buy as much, concluding in you having to live with less luxuries in your life or a lower standard of living. For the economy, high inflation harms business confidence. People don’t want to invest in an economy that isn’t guaranteed to give a return, a economy where companies are dipping deep into red or even shutting down as a result of rising costs and even additional menu & shoe-leather costs. [10]

## The Cause

There are various causes for inflation. The simplest reason is that demand exceeds supply, resulting in a rise in price. To go in depth, we need to understand why demand is exceeding supply. Is it because supply has decreased or demand has increased? It is important to note we are talking about aggregates, as in the whole nation, not a singular industry. What could make everyone demand more? What could make producers supply less?

The first conclusion one would come to is they have more money to spend, which would be a result of a higher income. Higher incomes can arrive through many paths. Higher incomes could be due to economic growth, as the economy becomes larger, each person gets more disposable income to spend. The issue in the case of America, as shown in the second graph above, is that wages have risen but the purchasing power of these wages or how much your money can buy has been stagnant, meaning this can’t be the cause.

Higher incomes can be ae result of lower interest rates, as low interest rates encourage borrowing which would mean people would have more money in their hands, resulting in more demand. As you can see, the rate of interest in the US, until 2021, had been steadily going down. Now the rate of interest has been hiked to fight inflation, but it’s the low interest rates before that probably caused it. [3]

In modern times, one of the common reasons for rising disposable incomes and inflation is the printing of money, which the Federal Reserve is notorious for (most reliable sources claim roughly 2 trillion was added in the last year and a half)[4]. More money in the economy means each dollar is worth less, resulting in the same product being more expensive in dollars to compensate for the lower value of the currency. Also, money being injected into the economy encourages spending which raises demand. [5]

Another reason can be government spending. [6] Government spends more money which creates jobs or redistributes income to the poor. More jobs mean more people have higher disposable incomes, resulting in greater demand. More money to the poor means money is being spent more, since the wealthy rarely spend even a fraction of their total wealth as they have a low marginal propensity to consume while someone living below poverty line has a very high marginal propensity to consume.[7]During the COVID pandemic, government spending shot up to deal with the crisis.

The ECB forum has written a paper on how “consumer demand spike during COVID” resulted in inflation. This is more regarding the EuroZone but since COVID hit the US too, it provides comparisons and details on the causation of the inflation there too. The link to the paper can be found in the references. [8]

On the flipside, inflation doesn’t only have to happen due to higher demand. Supply could be cut short too. The most popular reasoning for the supply being cut short and inflation due to supply side is the rising fuel prices. Even this has many sides: gas prices could’ve risen sharply as lockdown ended and prices recovered from the collapse of prices during 2020. They could have, and likely have, been severely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Russia is one of the major supplies of gas to the West, including the USA. [9]

## The Cure

The primary method of response by the government is to spike the rate of interest, which will reduce the money spent by consumers as they’d prefer to save and taking out loans would become more expensive. On the flipside, the harm is that possibly it could neuter economic growth as investors pull money from already poorly preforming stocks (as a result of inflation) and put it into a attractive savings account with high rate of interest. An article from the Colombia Business School argues that high interest rates may curb inflation but they will do more harm than good. [11]

Most solutions to inflation require contractionary policies, those that come with a heavy cost. The government has stated this as it’s primary solution but they may be utilising other economic tools to curb this issue.

As time goes on, we are able to see inflation waning. The year to year inflation is still alarmingly high but the month to month inflation has almost dipped to 0.[12] Inflation may be incredibly harmful, holding back economic development and lowering living standards. It can come from a assortment of sources, from injecting money to government spending, from lower interest rates to soaring fuel prices due to a war. It can be rectified in many ways too, most which come with a large cost.

The world had already had enough trouble with COVID, let’s hope this rocky path does not go much further down. Thank you for taking your time to read this article.

In order for money saved in a bank to retain it’s value, it needs to grow faster than inflation can devalue it, in other words, the rate of interest needs to exceed the rate of inflation.
