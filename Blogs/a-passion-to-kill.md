# A Passion to Kill

*Published: 2021-05-22*

The sky turned into a bright orange, with the sun shivering in its heat, slowly descending down the horizon. The sky was more dark blue-ish the further you went from the side of the sun, slowly erupting into a cloudy haze of blue and black. The mountains stood like white peaked goliaths, guarding the plains ahead. The sprawling evergreen furnished the barren land below. The breeze picked up the fresh air of the trees, the smell of nature, and carried it into the cabin.

The table I sat on was made of rosewood, a fine construction. I sipped my tea as I waited patiently for the arrival of a man, inspecting a watch that I was to give to him. It was quite old, the leather had some markings on it, so did the glass. It had been taken care of, within my possession and outside of it. The clock was still functional, you could hear the faint ticks. The watch was mechanical, it could’ve outlasted several owners. The design itself was definitely dated; pre-world war.

From the trail below my raised cabin, which sat on a small hill, granting me the view that I had previously described, I saw a black jeep coming towards my place of stay. I gulped my remaining tea and set off for downstairs, watch still on the table.

Down the steps, into the hallway. I was there just as the car pulled up into the driveway, the hum of the engine filling the soundless scape of my house. I opened my door, slightly flinching due to the freezing handle.

Gareth was standing outside, just about to lock his car. “Good evening Gareth, how was the trip?” I asked.

“It was good, lovely forest.” He replied.

I welcomed him in, brought him some food and coffee, and we sat down on the table where the watch was.

“So, er, here’s the watch.” I said, giving it to him. He inspected it closely, in some sort of nostalgia.

“Thanks a lot.” He said, after a considerable amount of time. His attention didn’t waver, it was still pinpointed at the watch.

“So, what’s the significance of this? You took a 5 hour drive for this.” I asked with my best attempt not to be rude.

“It’s my grandfather’s but it’s probably been in possession of many men before him. It was given to me on my first sail, a long time ago. I’d given it to you at the night of the crash. Uncertain time, yes. There was very little to know about what was going to happen, and that what must be preserved, must be accounted for first. The time I would be living was very variable, a stray shot and it would’ve ended. You, not so much. A better guard than me, you are. I see you have taken good care of it.” He explained to me.

“Ah, interesting.” I said as I nodded. He sipped his coffee.

“So, how are you?” He asked me, realizing he had forgotten social customs in pursuit of his precious.

“I’ve been well. Retired from work, as all of us have. Currently working on a painting, Alirath and Cthulu. A woman and a beast in battle. This reclusive lifestyle is the pillar for the creativity required to create something like that.” I replied.

He sighed slightly. “Actually, I haven’t really retired. In fact, I’ve come here to give you a offer. The night of the crash, I knew if I didn’t live, you would. And on a day that me or anyone of my association needed your help, they would come to you for this watch, and provide you with a offer.

It’s a 500 thousand dollar contract. Private services, taking out a conference in Africa. You in?” He told me.

I closed my eyes for a second. Everything was perfect right now, I had all the time in the world to myself, it was just me and nature. Did I really want to get back in? Was it worth it?

“Yes.” I said. No matter how much I lied to myself, I loved my profession, and it wasn’t just a job, it was a passion.
