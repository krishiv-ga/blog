# The Blue Reaping

*Published: 2020-03-17*


The sun overlooked the earth, shining in its blinding glory. It’s rays had baked my skin, and dried my soaked clothes. For a few minutes, there was pain, but then my sore limbs overpowered it. The heat slowly sucked out my energy, although being near the ocean gave me refuge to the cool breeze.

I didn’t know how I got here, or when. No recent events came to mind. The island seemed timeless, for I had been sitting in the same spot since sunrise, just before I woke up.

A few hours must have passed by, and no hunger or thirst came to my attention.

The sky was now a bright blue, with snow-white clouds trotting about. The trees danced to the beat of the breeze. The waves were calm and the ocean was a transparent cyan. The sand on this beach was smooth and white; it didn’t stick, it just flowed.

Feeling somehow refreshed, I got up and decided to explore the island.

The forest wasn’t dense, but the overgrowth was. Bushes popped up everywhere, with a dash of vines and poppies. The trees stood tall with wide canopies, like pillars to the roof of the forest. The grass had its own territories, though they were small and scarce. Small animals leapt from bush to bush and up the trees. Ants formed large supply chains on oak trees and small stones.

I walked directionless, probably hoping that I would reach the other end of the island, which I did pretty soon. The island was small, yet felt much larger. Now aiming to find some notable features I resumed my walk. With the apparent lack of information about my arrival to this island, I could assume that I would be staying here for a few nights, or for an eternity.

I walked for a while until I found a damp cave near a small stream. It was shallow, some smooth rock even protruded it. The front of the cave was sandy and was dotted with little bits of vegetation. I crossed the stream and then went inside the cave, which ended at the entrance.

The stream water was clear and seemed fresh so I decided to drink it. My unknown and unfelt thirst was relinquished and my throat felt unblocked. Now with my thirst gone, I had a feeling of relaxation which overcame me. I sat peacefully near the small stream, my legs in the water and my back on the sand.

I had dozed off, I woke up again suddenly, this time in the pain of my throbbing leg. Something had bit me, and it’s teeth cut deep. I inspected the bite, which had two neatly cut holes, deduced that it was a snake bite. The oozing bits of venom from my skin helped.I got up and crossed the stream in a hurry. I needed to find some antivenom, I had from a few minutes to a few hours left. Which snake was it? Which venom did it have? What’s the antivenom? Where do I find it?

These questions ran through my mind as I tried to scramble and find any herb which looked like an antivenom. I had no medical knowledge about any of this. I didn’t even know whether you made antivenom or you found it. I looked through the bushes. There were some red, purple and blue ones.

First, I tried the red ones. They were just sour berries. I spit them out immediately. Second, I tried the blue ones, which seem to make my blood vessels tighter, for some reason. The effect wore off in a few minutes. The purple berries were quite sweet. They must be some normal sort of local berry.

I knew that there was nothing that I could do now. The area around the bite started turning a cloudy blue. Soon enough I was back at the spot that I woke up in. I watched the sunset, with the sun slowly retreating and forfeiting to the night. The blue had spread to my waist now, and my legs were numb. Soon stars started popping into the sky. I watched them shimmer for a long time until I gave up due to exhaustion. I fell with my back on the sand, and my eyes were slowly shut.

The pain had stopped now, but the numbing had started working it’s way up. As my control on my body started fading, so did my consciousness.

It was just an endless replay of my most treasured and resentful memories. I felt nothing at all. Soon even the replay of memories stopped and everything faded to black.

A few seconds later a coldness came upon me and drove me out.
