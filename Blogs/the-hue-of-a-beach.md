# Hue of a Beach

*Published: 2021-04-18*

The waves splattered onto the sand, layered upon each other. The sun had almost retreated, with the sky shifting from orange to violet-black. The ocean had become greener in the evening, but a darker blue at night. Water just mirrored the colour of its environment, yet its tint came from the impurities in itself.

The sand was always a spectrum of a wet grey-brown and a baked cream-yellow. Marissa ran her hands through it, observing it intently. Doug sat near the water, staring at the horizon. Melissa swung her blonde hair, “aren’t you going to go inside?” She asked.

Doug took a deep breath, then he stood up. “No. These are my last days, I’d spend them on the beach rather than on a bed.” He replied. Melissa stood up and dusted off the sand. She placed her hand on Doug’s shoulder, “good luck, wherever you’re going.”
