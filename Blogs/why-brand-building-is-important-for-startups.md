# Why Brand Building Is Important For Startups

*Published: 2022-04-14*

Brand building is essential for any corporation to thrive, whether you are making steel, manufacturing hard drives, or creating a social media app. Apple is one of the top players in this space, with millions of diehard users who pour billions into their products every year. Their brand strategy is simple: the Apple brand is associated with a certain set of positive traits: clean design, simplicity, and reliability. Although their policy may be simple, it is enforced through painstaking checks in product design, marketing, and public relations.

The first notable year for Apple in the brand building was 1984 when they spent 1.5 million on a Super Bowl commercial, which put them on the map. Apple had been building its identity for a while, after Steve Jobs left, John Sculley who was the former CEO of Pepsi replaced him and used his marketing skills to further the brand but a lack of innovation led to stagnation which concluded in Jobs joining back as interim CEO.

As Neil Patel, an author who has written on Apple analyses, “Apple focuses on their UVP (unique value proposition), which is a beautiful design that works right out of the box with ever-smaller packaging. It’s a marketing strategy that gets juice throughout social media and is very much a competitive advantage for Apple and its market share.”

Apple thrives in its ecosystem, it has its own software and many perks to switching all your electronic devices to Apple which almost forces brand loyalty for consumers, and exclusives like Final Cut draw in those reluctant to make the switch simply because of the promises of minimalism and reliability.

The essential takeaway here is brand building isn’t limited to your marketing department, it requires effort from product design, customer service, corporate leadership, and all other aspects of your company, not to mention, brand building isn’t just for the consumers, it’s for all of your stakeholders.

Investors need to know your company is consistently profitable, workers that your firm is a respectable, high-paying place to work in, and consumers that your product is better than the competition and that your brand carries value. Apple hits the mark in all three, with it making high profits consistently for over two decades, with intense competition for spots in the company due to the prestige, good pay, and amazing work environment in the firm and the famous Apple brand image and the connotations your average shopper relates it to.
