# Austrian Business Cycle Theory; An Introduction

*Published: 2021-09-06*

The Austrian School of Economics is a group of Economists that believe in laissez-faire capitalism. They have a business cycle theory which is called the Austrian Business Cycle theory. Before we get into the topic at hand, we need to preface this idea by understanding what business cycles are.

A business cycle is an economic theory which attempts to explain the patterns of economic growth and recession in an economy. The Austrian business cycle theory says that the periodic recessions and booms are due to the government interfering with the rate of interest. It says that the rate of interest is the ‘coordinating function between time and investments’ which is just big words for, it is a way to tell what kind of investments entrepreneurs and investors should make.

It does it directly, and indirectly. If people are saving more, they are delaying their spending into the future, so businesses should be investing into longer term projects which will be profitable around the time consumers take out those savings to spend. 

The government tends to intervene in the market of the rate of interest by controlling it, usually by lowering it to make borrowing easier and spending tougher, to increase aggregate demand. This sends the wrong signal to producers, because they are supposed to be investing in longer term projects, but they invest in projects that no one wants. Now, in this analogy we are taking a single builder or a single private entity and it’s decisions, but you can see how if you apply this to every single industry in an economy, how it can quickly become catastrophic. 

The rate of interest also relates to lending and monetary policy, artificially low interest rates are also combined (to add fuel to the fire) with the printing of money into the economy. These two combined leads to credit expansion through lending by banks, which also reduces the liquidity of their assets. When these loans fail or the value against liquidity of these banks is corrected the whole market drops. This is a major problem but not the end of the world when it’s done to goods, for example, the market of computer mice, but when it’s done to markets like housing, it leads to stuff like ‘08. 

Not only does this malinvestment lead to wrong investment that no one wants, it leads to incredible wastage of resources, which leads to the economy being of much lower value than it appears. And when the markets readjust, usually after an irregular phenomenon or such, the number line comes crashing down, and so does the world economy.

There are many criticisms of this theory, especially from the Keynesian school of economics. One of the most boldest, and one of the most illogical claims by this school of economics is that this business cycle theory is not empirical (this usually comes from the notion that austrians aren’t empiricists or realists because they don’t use incredibly generalised ‘empirical’ aggregates to calculate large scale economic data  and ‘verify’ their theories). This has been disproven by one of the most loved figures in libertarian politics, Ron Paul himself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMAM1_96GSc

He predicted the early 1990s recession, and it went just as the business cycle theory describes: there was a set of years of restrictive policy controlling the rate of interest and money supply (they are heavily related) and followed by a oil price shock (which is the irregular phenomenon) which set off the wildfire in the markets. 

Another completely unfounded argument is that the Great Depression is an example of this theory failing as there were ‘free markets’ before the great depression and America had the gold standard, a currency backed by a precious metal (in this case gold), should’ve stopped it. Once you look at America’s monetary policy before the great depression, you will understand why it occurred and why it was so utterly devastating.

America had a gold standard and limited control on the supply of money, yes, but not during war. During the war, the gold standard was temporarily removed to have a fiat system, so that banks could print enough money to support the war effort. This absolutely destroyed the market, and before, many firms didn’t have risk protections against these, not to mention the economy hadn’t faced anything like that, so, the depression happened and devastation followed.

Instead of realising their mistake, the government doubled down on their fiat system, which has led to consistent recessions that Austrians are always accurately able to predict, as proven in my Ron Paul paragraph.

These are just two of the criticisms and one singular example of a rebuttal to each, but economic philosophy goes much deeper than this and exploring each argument and each counter argument, as well as going into the statistics and the core derivations of this theory are out of the scope of this article, but I will, for this and all future articles, link some average sized lectures, other reputable articles from austrian economists and short videos in simple language explaining this concept in varying levels of depth, all more than what I could do here today.

Thank you for reading.

For further reading, I recommend Anglo Libertarian’s (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlfzOPFfIBA) video on it, although nothing academic, he does a brilliant job explaining the topic in simple words and highly recommended watch after reading this article.

I also recommend two lectures from Mises institute, firstly, from the genius Tom Woods (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a-eUKjnDfM) who explains the whole concept with a respectable amount of depth in a very very short amount of time, also a highly recommended listen. The second is a wonderful and very in-depth explanation from David Howden, (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlfzOPFfIBA) which explains some common misconceptions too, although it is on the longer side in comparison to the previous two.

For the reading part, I would recommend the Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_business_cycle_theory#%22Malinvestment%22_and_%22boom%22) on this, especially as a brief introduction to the idea and a great article from the Mises wire.
