# Damned

A strong, dry wind rusted across the desert. The heat was dizzying. Gordon dragged his leather satchel on the ground, which created small clouds of dust. He stopped and lit up a cigarette. It was hot, but that wasn’t going to stop him from taking a few puffs.

He had been walking for a long time. Time had no meaning anymore, for his journey continued on forever in this desolate desert. He felt no more pain, as his limbs were numb. Occasionally he’d find a pack lying here and there—how it got there, he’d not know—but he’d not pass the opportunity of taking ‘em with him, for it was a rare gift.

A few hours went by, and a large, red-stoned hill was near. He could see a tree on one of its sides and some wooden object. Soon he realised it was a bench. On it was a young lad, with leather shoes and a hat. A fat cigar in his mouth, a golden ring on his right index finger.

Gordon walked towards him and he got up.

‘Howdy,’ the man said.

‘Hey. What ya doin’ in these parts?’ Gordon asked.

‘Nothin’. Servin’ my sentence like you are,’ he told him.

‘Morningstar, huh?’ Gordon asked.

‘Yeah. It’s been a long time since the garden, but I’m still not used to Earth,’ Lucifer answered. He took a puff of his cigar.

‘I know why you’re here. I can help,’ Lucifer continued.

‘What kind?’ Gordon asked.

‘I’ll get you outta this mess. You’re the man who did it. The man who beat God,’ he said in an impressed voice.

‘Okay, but what do you get outta this?’ Gordon asked.

‘I want Him to suffer. That’s more than enough for my pleasure,’ he answered.

Gordon nodded. He understood. God wasn’t someone Lucifer liked. Little things like freeing his prisoners would please Lucifer—and piss Him off.

With a snap, Gordon began to fall from the sky. He’d been stuck in the prisons of Heaven for a long time. It was time to go back home again. Only if home still existed…

He was about to fall to the ground and was going to brace for impact, but he went right through.

‘What the—’ he said.

‘I said I’d free ya. Not bring back your soul. Now you can either wander in the Limbo or help me in Hell. Oh, I just forgot. You don’t have a soul anymore. You’re mine now,’ Lucifer said with a glint in his eyes.

There was always a trick. Always a catch when you’d make a deal with the devil. He’d served his sentence in Heaven, and now was going to do his penance in Hell.

Three figures in black cloaks and bones for fingers dragged him down to a large red gate made up of millions of skulls. The gate opened and the screams of the damned filled his ears.

‘Abandon all hope, ye who enter here,’ Gordon chanted as he entered the gates.
