# A Christmas Hunt

*Published: 2021-04-18*

The snow glistened as it softly fell upon the heaps that were already there. It had become knee-deep, almost tiresome to travel through, but the spirit remained. The cold whish of the wind sucked the life out of all that wasn’t native and whipped them until they froze from inside. The cold would always creep in, so journeys had to be made in haste.

The party was small, with only three men. One with a rifle, one with a skinner and one with a large sack. They all had their own struggles against the frost, one was vulnerable to the creeping cold, another was too stout for snow and the last was a foreigner, and wasn’t used to these harsh hellscapes.

They had come hunting for deer, but they would be satisfied with ox too. Canadian winters were long, especially in the west, and here was where the predators and savages reigned.

Their hunt was a successful one, nothing too great. They were on their return to their town, where they would sell the meat and hide and earn their daily buck. The fog of night was now ever-present, limiting visibility to an arm’s width. The wind had begun it’s nightly lashing, and they did not want to come in its way.

“Faster, Harold,” said Jacob as he tightened his grip on the rifle. Harold had a hard time keeping up, tugging his sack full of meat and hide with him. Mark was silent, and leading the way.

They traversed about half of the way before it happened. Mark heard a snuff, and then a couple of footsteps. The wind was cold and harsh, but not loud. Jacob also heard it, and appropriately took aim in the direction of the sound. Harold was occupied in dragging the sack that he didn’t take much notice, but he knew that something strange was about, for his mates had stopped in their tracks.

Then the howls began, and the pack rushed in. There were about 4 or 5 of them, and all were surrounding them. Mark was a regular here, he knew how to deal with wolves. Standing your ground was the most important part, for running was a fool’s errand with these beasts.

He looked one in its green eyes and unsheathed his dagger. He swung close to it and the wolf backed off, so did rest of the pack. Jacob shot a shot in the air for intimidation, and it worked. He shot again near one of the wolves and they began to run.

Harold was out of breath, although he was not fearful of wolves and the beasts of the wintery mountains, he was cautious.

They came back to town and sold the deer to the butcher. Each made a good buck but a short-lived one. Deer hunting was already becoming off grounds, and the winters harsher. It would be their last hunt, but an unforgettable one.
