# Why Microsoft Has the Home Advantage in the Battle for the Metaverse

*Published: 2022-03-13*

The Metaverse is the new buzzword flooding business and tech circles. It is a logical continuation of the Internet; a virtual space but rather than just a set of web pages it is an entire ‘world’ that intends to be ‘immersive’. This idea has existed for a long time in gaming, for example in the MMORPG industry which aims to create massively multiplayer worlds where people can role play as another ‘character’ or person. This fits quite close to what the Metaverse is trying to achieve. In more recent times, VRChat has dominated the multiplayer VR scene as the primary form of VR social interaction, where people can talk face to face as different characters in a virtual VR environment.

The eventual arrival of this idea was to be expected but considering the state of technology right now, for the consumer side, this is a bit ahead of its time. VR hasn’t been adopted by most people, nor do most people consider or care about it. VR software isn’t the most advanced and most VRs require cables to connect to powerful PCs if one wants to experience an immersive world in high graphical fidelity. For the next few years, it is reasonable to say that the main market for the Metaverse will be the corporate customers.

The state of the corporate market is looking very bright, many firms are eager to upgrade their digital collaboration infrastructure after the devastating blow from the COVID pandemic to workspaces in the last two years. Although tools like Google Meet and Zoom are sufficient for teams to collaborate, they are far from ideal. A virtual meeting room in an artificial 3d space would be much preferable, especially for teams that work on more practical projects.

The two main firms fighting for the Metaverse are Meta (Facebook) and Microsoft. Both of these firms have openly stated their desire to enter the market, Facebook going as far as completely rebranding their firm towards it. Facebook is trying to create a truly virtual Metaverse where everyone can meet while Microsoft is using its AR and VR technologies to create tools for collaboration in virtual 3d spaces.

It is quite clear in this battle Microsoft has the advantage. As I’ve concluded before, the main market right now for the Metaverse is the corporate digital tools market. Microsoft has been developing digital corporate tools for over two decades now with their infamous office suite including things almost every professional has used once such as Word or PowerPoint. Microsoft has invested heavily into Augmented Reality (virtual objects in a real 3d space) and has even developed a second iteration of their AR glasses lineup, HoloLens 2, which is marketed towards professionals such as Doctors or Construction Workers.

Facebook has not invested greatly in AR or VR other than Oculus. It does not have any major history in creating corporate digital tools and Facebook has a poor image when it comes to the reliability and quality of its software. On top of this, recently suffered from its largest drop in value ever, about 250 billion dollars, which suggests investor disapproval after the widespread marketing campaigns for the Metaverse and the complete brand overhaul of the firm.

It is very possible for Facebook to win this battle, but it is not likely considering the tools at Microsoft’s disposal. Microsoft also owns Xbox and many game studios, recently they did a 70 billion dollar all-cash transaction to purchase one of the industry giants in gaming, Activision-Blizzard. Just a year or so ago they bought Bethesda, another industry giant. Microsoft is moving towards becoming the biggest player in gaming which is an even bigger plus for Microsoft as to when they do decide to enter the consumer market, they will have the studios to produce virtual experiences that consumers will enjoy in gaming franchises that they love.
