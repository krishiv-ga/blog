# Russian Roulette

Robert walked down the slope and onto the icy steps. The wind was howling, creating a massive force, tugging his already weak body to the side, into the forest. The snow was deep, but not deadly. The true monster at these heights was the ice, which pierced through your blood in the form of frostbite and consumed every surface, creating thin sheets of guaranteed death to those who didn’t proceed with caution.
He worked his way down to a cottage. It was a small one, the size of roughly 3 or 4 baby elephants with the chimney barely crossing over 9 feet. The build was of good quality, nice bricks which were properly cemented and decent wood which had even been painted. Although the quality was good, time wasn’t on its side. The bricks had a slight fade into them, as they were greying over the years in which they faced the harsh side of nature.
There was a large square on the right wall to the door, from which a yellow light cascaded onto the snow. It was probably fire, from the hearth of a fireplace, as such things were essential in these winters. The door was much older, probably an imported one looking at from the type of timber. Robert grasped its stained golden handle and pushed it open.
Inside was a classic ‘cosy’ form of interior. A red-white patterned rug, a purple sofa, a table with red wine and a proportionally large fireplace crackling the sparks of flames. The indoor walls were of wood, not brick. There was foam seeping through the left-bottom corner and there were some ‘patches’ on the floorboard.
The man sitting in the chair got up. He was wearing grey checkered pants and a white shirt with a grey checkered coat. His shoes were long, shiny and black. He wore a red tie, which he adjusted as he got up.
He turned to the Christmas decorations which were laying on top of a slab above the fireplace. “Ah, Solomon. It’s been long, actually never, since I’ve seen you. Many thanks for coming in a time like this, I was getting bored from my fifth reading of Macbeth, sadly, there was no other decent book left. Luckily you’re here.” The man said, with a trace of a southern accent.
“Nothing. Just coming to check on you, making sure you haven’t killed yourself again.” Robert replied, putting down his hat and taking a seat on the left side of the sofa. The man filled a glass of wine, “1945, just a hundred years go. Today is its anniversary, maybe we can free it of its virginity.” He gave me a glass of wine; which Robert took a sip of. The taste was sweet, yet still had a hint of the bitterness of freshly harvested wine.
They sipped the wine in silence. As Robert drank more, he savoured more. Maybe it was the drunkenness, maybe it was the charm of old wine.
“Want to play a game?” He asked. “Nothing better to do. Why not.” Robert replied.
He took out a revolver, a grey one with a 6-barrel. He placed it on the desk in front of him. He took out another identical one, and placed that on the other side of the desk, facing Robert.
“Each one of these has a single bullet in them. Spin the barrel and hope for the best” He said.
They both placed the revolvers on each other’s head. Russian roulette. What a graceful death, a gambler dies on an unlucky gamble. The odds were even, but one of them would meet an easy death.
They began their first clicks. No shot fired.
They did the second. No shot fired.
They did the third. No shot fired.
They did the fourth. The bullet pierced through Robert’s skull, making him lunge back onto the sofa. His head was completely ruined, with the bullet creating a gaping hole in his forehead.
“Expected.” The man said and took the second gun to his mouth. Click. He fired and the bullet pierced his throat. There were no winners, there were never meant to be.
