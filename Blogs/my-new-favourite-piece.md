# My New Favourite Piece

*Published: 2020-02-23*

This is purely my opinion and doesn’t reflect the thoughts and intentions of the composer.

This is more of a rather opinionated write up but bear with me. I can guarantee that the composition is a masterpiece, only if you can appreciate classical music, that is.

The piece is called Chopin Etude Op 10 No.3, also known as Tristesse, which is the french equivalent of sadness.

The piece is quite depressing, but it’s perfect in a way.

The song is can be split into 5 parts from a emotional perspective. The first part is the normal boredom or blandness of life in which not much happens thanks to the hedonic curse.

The second part is a display of what most would call a mental breakdown. Many with depression have felt this, where everything becomes overly pessimistic and horrible. It’s a surge of hidden pain, somewhere deep in the inside.

The third part is when you come out of the hole and feel pretty wholesome for some time. This displays happiness.

The fourth is anger. This is after the stage of that short burst of happiness in which most regret their existence. Their situation, no matter how good, seems unfair.

The fifth part is the second part all over again, telling the audience that it’s a vicious, repetitive cycle of everlasting sadness, a bit of happiness and then sadness again.

There’s a lot of hidden meaning in a piece which most, in modern times, consider boring or bland.

You can check it the piece on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzBH9Nm1BP8).

Thanks for reading and you don’t have to mention if it’s cringe af.
