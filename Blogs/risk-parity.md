# The Power of Risk Parity  
*Published: June 1, 2025*

Risk parity is a portfolio construction strategy that focuses on allocating risk rather than capital.

## Why It Matters  
Traditional portfolios, like 60/40 equity-bond mixes, often end up being dominated by equity risk. Risk parity balances this by giving each asset class an equal contribution to total portfolio volatility.

### Core Ideas:
- Equal risk contribution across asset classes
- Leverages low-volatility assets like bonds
- Often uses volatility forecasting models

> “In the long run, it’s about risk allocation, not just return maximization.”
