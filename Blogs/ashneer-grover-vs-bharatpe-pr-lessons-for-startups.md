# Ashneer Grover vs BharatPe: A PR Lesson for Startups

*Published: 2022-04-09*

Ashneer Grover is an accomplished businessman, having graduated from IIT/IIM and having worked in prominent firms such as Kotak Investment Bank or American Express while also being a very noticeable investor having funded the growth of Grofers and become a co-founder of one of India’s unicorns: #BharatPe. In recent times, his relationship with the company has sailed into murky waters which climaxed with him resigning and his wife being fired under allegations of fraud while being under investigation by PWC which was hired by the firm.

Even more recently, he dissed the CEO of BharatPe after an employee claimed that he was not paid his salary; he stated that this is outrageous and later called for the firing of the CEO, but Mr. Sameer retorted by saying that he had taken all the funds of the firm. This is not the first time Ashneer Grover has found himself in hot waters, he made headlines after an alleged fiery conversation with a bank employee regarding the missing of funds that Mr. Grover was about to put into Nykaa’s IPO and Sequoia dropping investments into BharatPe after an argument that Mr. Grover had with one of the managers of the fund.

What can we learn from this PR disaster? As firms, we should keep checks and balances to keep corporate disputes internal. Public controversies, whether they end up in your firm being right or wrong will tarnish your name. Big firms deal with angry and vengeful employees all the time, but they are able to shut them down before they can do any serious damage to the firm’s reputation. There should be serious consequences for doing such irrational actions.

We shouldn’t rely on one key stakeholder for everything nor give them too much influence or power. Giving too much influence and power to investors in a company can lead them to leverage their power for their own benefit at the cost of the future of the company, as warned in The Startup Masterplan, “Additionally, as most venture capitalists Sourcing for finance is only in it for the money (who is not?), they may sell their shares to unknown buyers in a few years.”

Lastly, as businessmen, we must ensure we maintain a healthy and professional public image that shows us as good leaders. Any sort of controversy isn’t good, people have lost their entire careers by going into even a minute-long debate with a customer on something that isn’t even their fault.

The book discusses extensively how to make better decisions as an entrepreneur and how to set up your business for success. We use real-life examples to understand the abstract concepts of different modes of thinking and methodologies to business. In order to avoid blunders like this, one needs to have the foresight and our book can prepare you for such foresight.
