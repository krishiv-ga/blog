The waves were layered beautifully over each other like folded silk. They were of turquoise colour, clear and calming. A breeze blew northwards, against me. It blew through my face, sucking the heat out of it, it blew into my lungs, cooling my blood. The waves splashed over each other and onto the shore, making a soothing, progressively high pitched sound.

The sand I sat on was white, like snow, but of a different texture. It wasn’t rough or sticky, it was rather fluffy, smooth and soft. The beach extended across the horizon, east and west. It had no beginning and no end.

The sun turned from bright yellow to a deep orange. With it, the sky turned from a clear light blue to dark blue and now was fading into darkness. It was like every night where the sky became transparent, and one could see the heavens above.

It was getting late. She had promised to meet me here at sunset, and that was soon to come. I had come much earlier, for I had no duties that day. Secretly, I longed for her. Her heart-warming smile. Her sweet voice. Her way of doing things.

I had come here on short notice, without a given reason.

Sunset had come. The sun shone it’s last rays of light before retiring for the night. The night spilled over the dark blue sky which seemed to fade its colour into the sea. Slowly, the heavens descended down to the earth, where the sky was. The moon dawned upon the sky, younger brother of the sun, shining through the night.

I frowned as she was late, a habit she detested and regularly pestered me about. I waited patiently but slowly the reality drew upon me.

The waves splashed endlessly, again and again over the coarse rocks far off, making the smooth. The air was now different, more moist and fresh. A dark cloud was brewing deep into the ocean. It would reach me soon, engulfing the dark sky and pushing the heavens back into space. It would rain, I would drench. Now that I had come this far and waited this long, I’d rather stay and enjoy the shower rather than go home and do the usual.

Thunder cracked. The soothing sound of the waves was replaced with the sound of the screeching wind, rumbling clouds and the monstrous waves which had been created by this storm. A wave of rain hit me. It was thick and dense and immediately drenched my clothes.

There was a silence for around a minute. My clothes started sticking to my skin and slowly draining the heat out of them. I felt very cold. I knew that it wasn’t going to end well.

The rain drops bombarded the beach sand, making it dark brown from a perfect white. They hit my face and body, less frequently but with great force. The shower had turned into a downpour. 

The entire time I bent my head to protect my sight from the wrath of the rain but now it was too late. Water from my hair was flowing through my neck and cheeks. I looked at the ocean. It looked unusually calm. The waves were small again and the water peaceful.

Something out of the ordinary was going to happen.

Suddenly a section of the water near the beach was now tinted in a light blue, like there was something glowing down there. Slowly the tint became stronger until the original colour of the water was lost and all that was left was the glowing blue light. Soon a blue orb started appearing, with a dim glow.

Inside was a woman. Her head was tilted upwards and her hands were loosely stretched out. I couldn’t make anything out about her body because it had been covered by some dark blue-black ink which flowed around abdomen, waist and chest.

As the orb came out of the water and about 2 meters into the air, the woman’s head tilted back to a normal stature. Her eyes were glowing of a bluish white. Her hair now flowed across her shoulders, suspended in the contents of the orb.

The orb slowly faded out and she descended onto the beach. She wore a swimsuit of sorts, with shades of green, turquoise, dark blue and blue-green on small scales which were perfectly aligned westwards. It only covered the main body, the limbs were bare.

As her feet touched the ground her hair stopped floating and spread across her shoulders. It was of a bright blonde. Her eyes stopped glowing and were now a lightish blue.

As I recovered from what I had just seen, I got a hint of familiarity from her.

It was her.
