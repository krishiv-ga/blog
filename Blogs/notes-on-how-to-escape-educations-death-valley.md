# Notes on How to Escape Education's Death Valley

*Published: 2021-04-18*

These are some notes on the TED talk by Sir Ken Robinson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX78iKh…

The current system believes in conformity over individuality, even though the latter is of human nature. It believes in narrowing down talents to the STEM subjects, rather than have a broader spectrum of subjects including arts and humanities.

The problem with education is the attitude and priorities of education boards, schools, and teaching. Standardised testing is prioritised over actual learning. Children aren’t taught to learn things because they’re interesting or ‘cool’, they’re taught to learn things because it’s important for exams.

Education without learning isn’t education at all. Children are natural learners, and if the pressure of examinations and a possibly ruined future has to be present to encourage the repeated cramming of information, then that’s not education. Education must be driven by curiosity and love for the subject.

As stated before, every individual is different, and they will path towards different subjects as they grow up. It is necessary to identify the desires and interests of a student and create their curriculum appropriately. Curriculums are in no way personalised, and that makes them a few decades behind the attitude of businesses and people in other sectors today.

This lack of personalisation is due to education’s adamancy to retain it’s old, industrialised way of teaching in a world where personalisation and modernisation is the norm. The teaching system set up in the industrial revolution is the system that still persists today, and it’s was a step backwards.

The solution to fixing education is not easy, but direct. First of all, there needs to be a change in attitude, from getting good grades, to understanding the subject and having an interest in it. Secondly, there needs to be a reform in teaching. Classrooms need to be more engaging, the teacher-student dynamic needs to balance and curriculums need to be personalised to a student’s interests. All of these problems can be solved with technology, but they’ve been solved without them.

Finland is a world leader in education, and it is one of the few countries which gets it right.

The change to actual education is neither that difficult nor that expensive. The problems need to be addressed, and the solutions need to be implemented. They’re already there, ready to be deployed.
