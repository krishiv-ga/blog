# Backtesting Basics for Quant Strategies  
*Published: April 10, 2025*

Backtesting is the process of testing a strategy on historical data before live deployment.

## Key Considerations:
- **Data quality**: Clean, accurate OHLCV data
- **Look-ahead bias**: Using data not available at the time
- **Transaction costs**: Slippage, commissions, spreads
- **Overfitting**: Too many parameters = fragile model

## Best Practice
Always validate out-of-sample and use walk-forward testing if possible.
