# Bonds and Yields to Maturity

*Published: 2023-07-20*

Bond markets are a key part of anyone’s portfolio- and currently they’re creating a buzz on Wall Street. After years of severely underperforming, bonds are back to being a great bang for your buck. During my first week at Motilal Oswal, I covered bonds, their yields and their yield curves to better understand why they are a core asset in fixed income portfolios, the project title of my internship. I’ve penned this article as a exercise on my own understanding and possibly a useful reference for anyone interested. Thanks for taking your time to read it!

In the last few months, bonds as a fixed income asset class have been surging. Retail investors are slowly becoming more aware of the fact that the bonds market is twice the size of the stock market in terms of value- and for good reason. Hikes in the rate of interest by the Fed has resulted in dropping bond prices and booming yields.

For the unfamiliar, a bond is in its simplest form, a loan from an investor to an institution. When a institution issues a bond, they pay coupons (interest) every year along with the principal (amount lent) at maturity (at the end of the loan). The interest rate on bonds is called the coupon rate.

Before we move further, we must understand how bond markets work. Bonds are issued by the institution to investors. Investors lend the required amount which is set as the principal or the par value. Afterwards, investors may wish to sell the bond in secondary markets where the price of the bond is determined by several other factors, such as the interest rate, the yield to maturity of other bonds in the same risk class and the performance of the economy.

## Understanding Yield To Maturity

In finance, whenever we look at an asset, the first thing we consider is the rate of return. In bond markets, the rate of return is called the Yield to Maturity (YtM). Yield to Maturity can be used as a comparator by investors during shopping for assets.

The rate of return of an asset is significantly affected by the price of an asset, the same can be said for the yield to maturity of a bond.

Another major factor for the yield on a bond is the credit rating of a bond or how ‘safe’ it is. A risky bond requires to have higher yields as investors demand compensation for the risk they are taking on. A safer bond tends to have lower yields as assets in the same risk class tend to have low returns.

## Yield Curves

A yield curve is a line that maps the yields of bonds with varying maturities but the same credit rating. Generally, it is used as an indicator of the health of the economy and the bond market. There are three kinds of yield curves:

Upward sloping yield curves represent rising yields over time. This indicates economic growth to investors and infers a bullish outlook.

Downward sloping yield curves represent falling yields over time. This indicates economic slowdown to investors and infers a bearish outlook.

Flat yield curves represent similar yields across all maturities. This indicates uncertainty in the market.

Investors can use the yield curve to make predictions about the economy to make investment decisions. If the bond yield curve indicates an economic slowdown, investors might move their money into defensive assets that traditionally do well during a recession. If the yield curve becomes steep, this might signal future inflation. 

Yield curve risk represents the risk presented to investors due to change in the rate of interest. If, for example, the interest rate increases greater than the yield, the investor will be losing out on money by putting their investments in a bond rather than debt. Also, the price of the bond would fall to compensate for this, resulting in a further loss of value.

## Final Thoughts

Bonds can be a great asset to invest into; they tend to be safer, usually guaranteed by centuries old corporations or government entities. They give out predictable returns as the coupon rates are fixed, although yields can vary based on price; if you buy in the primary market or at par, you should get what you pay for. 

In a time when banks crumble within weeks and the market can switch from bullish to bearish by the hour, bonds might be the right choice for the confused retail investor looking to get that 8% until retirement.
