# A Delivery in Knox

*Published: 2021-04-18*

Galahad trotted with his steed down the dirt pathway. He was in the grasslands, green and vast, crossing the horizons. He had come here to the village of Knot, which had a strange name, but all of New Britan did.

He rode past the evergreen trees, which had stood the test of time. These forests were sacred, filled with wild creatures and secrets of old. Great myths had been born here, from Bgolinsk, the four-headed boar, to Alahand, the tiger-taled peacock.

There were stranger beings, but all were strange in these foreign lands. The folk weren’t used to such soil, nor were the to such beasts. The great crossing had been hard on some, some were driven mad by what they saw here, and others had slaughtered themselves after men had decided to return to the olden ways.

Earth was a beauty, but it had become spoils of war. Development beyond the simple ways was toxic, and although not all agreed, many did. The rest, who didn’t, decided to rot back home.

Galahad had reached the village. The cottages were made of yellow brick and black stone. The glass was of purple tint.

Washerwomen were cleaning clothes by the well in the town hall. Merchants were selling odd fruits and hunters were selling hides. Galahad got off his horse and went into the town hall.

It was a rather small office, just a wooden desk and a large window at the side. A couple of cupboards and bookshelves, and a few chairs placed in front of his desk. The wood was Evermore, an elven kind. Those strange creatures knew their craftwork and were the pillar of the great shift.

The mayor puffed a fat cigar of some local weed. He was surprisingly in shape, in comparison to his peers in other towns. Galahad had come to deliver a letter, from the king’s shipwarden.

There was a ship to be landing from earth soon, and he had to steer the villagers away.
